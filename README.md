<b> Calibration </b> <br />
Slowly position the camera until the spectrum is in view then, scroll your mouse or trackpad to adjust the width of the yellow box. This yellow box should only contain the spectrum, since each column will averaged to calculate the intensity of each wavelength. Once the desired spectrum is sufficiently in frame, you can disconnect the camera to be left with a still image. Click "Open Calibration Menu". Using a reference for where the peaks should appear for your spectrum, align the green sliders to these peaks. Then enter the reference wavelength for each peak, and click "Update Calibration". Be sure to only do this once. The following is an example of a calibrated spectrum (the Balmer series for hydrogen).
